# ZenfolioApplication

Project Specifications

Create a command line application that takes in a user input.
After the input the application will display the result and prompt the user for a new input.
The application will only exit with the word "quit".
The user input will be either a numerical sequence or a literal string.

With a numerical sequence input find the mean, median, mode, and range.

With a literal string count the occurrence of each character and display it in alphabetical order. Spaces and special characters will be ignored.


Assumptions:
-The mode can be multimodal
-For the mean and range, I can use the .Average() and .Count() functions
